            <p>
                Welcome to SPMods, a dedicated platform built by a group of alumni for
                Singapore Polytechnic students! We understand the challenges you face
                when navigating your modules, and we&#39;re here to make your academic
                journey smoother and more connected.
            </p>

            <SectionHeader>üéØ Our Purpose</SectionHeader>
            <p>
                Have you ever wished there was a central place to get advice on modules
                from seniors, prepare for upcoming semesters, or simply discuss
                module-related questions with your peers? We did too! That&#39;s why we
                created SPMods to address these common challenges:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-4 space-y-2 my-3">
                <li>
                    <span className="font-bold">
                        No dedicated space for senior advice:
                    </span>{" "}
                    Students who have already completed a module often lack a dedicated
                    channel to share valuable tips and insights with juniors. SPMods
                    provides that space.

                    <span className="font-bold">No central module preparation hub:</span>{" "}
                    It can be tough to explore and prepare for upcoming modules,
                    especially during semester breaks, without a unified platform. SPMods
                    aims to be your go-to resource.

                    <span className="font-bold">Scattered student discussions:</span>{" "}
                    Module-related conversations are often fragmented across various
                    social media platforms and informal groups. We&#39;re bringing them
                    all together in one place.
